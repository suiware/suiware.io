description: Let's meet with Suiware, its founder and current projects.
---

Welcome to the Suiware place, frens!

At Suiware, we develop tools, templates and SDKs for the Sui ecosystem and also demonstrate how to effectively develop for Sui.

Suiware has been founded by [Kos Komelin](https://x.com/kkomelin) who regularly participate in Sui hackathons and contribute to the Sui ecosystem.

Some of our projects:

- [Sui dApp Starter](https://sui-dapp-starter.dev) - the easiest way to start a new React/Move project.
- [@suiware/ai-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suiware/ai-tools) - pluggable tools for Vercel AI SDK which allow AI assistants to interact with Sui Network (transfer, swap, stake, etc).
- [@suiware/mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suiware/mcp) - an MCP server with built-in `@suiware/ai-tools` and API to use in your apps.
- [MerSui](https://mersui.xyz) - a simple "Buy Me a Coffee" React button with payments in SUI.

Follow us on [X](https://x.com/suiware_) or [Github](https://github.com/suiware) to ride the wave of everything juicy that's coming next from us!
