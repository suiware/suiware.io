It was my first Sui Basecamp and my first time in Dubai. That trip reshaped my views and broadened my horizons but first things first...

<!--truncate-->

## The City

Every city has its own soul/vibe and Dubai is no exception. Dubai is about business and scale, and I think it greatly influenced the conference.

Dubai is international, it's colossal, it's also not cheap, so you need to know why you're there - to fundraise, to partner, to scale? Basically, to act!

## The Conference

Sui Basecamp is the biggest gathering of Sui devs, users, infra providers and investors. For you to get the scale, it was 2000 people registered.

There were three parallel session tracks, such as Main (state, vision and plans), Dev (dev innovations) and Ecosystem (partners, projects and such), Expo zone (sponsor booths) and some side-activities.

To be honest, I didn't attend as many talks as I wanted during the basecamp. Got lost in discussions with my fellow hackers and the community, which were quite fruitful by the way. It was nice to see how fellow hackers were progressing with their projects.

## Some Alpha

Of course, I cannot cover everything but let me give you an idea:

- [Move Registry (MVR)](https://www.moveregistry.com/?utm_source=suiware.io) - now every package deployed on chain can have its own short name which you can use to access the package from other packages, or just learn the source code. I think it's a huge improvement in terms of security, education and transparency.
- [Walrus](https://www.walrus.xyz/?utm_source=suiware.io) - programmable storage, powered by Sui, is growing, now in mainnet with its own token.
- [Seal](https://www.mystenlabs.com/blog/mysten-labs-launches-seal-decentralized-secrets-management-on-testnet?utm_source=suiware.io) - a new secret management solution by Mysten Labs, currently in testnet.
- [Nautilus](https://blog.sui.io/nautilus-offchain-security-privacy-web3/?utm_source=suiware.io) - verifiable off-chain computation.
- More Bitcoin liquidity is coming to Sui, for example powered by Stacks (sBTC).

## What Else

Besides talking to people and listening to talks, I tried on-chain coffee crafted by Mysten Labs hackers:

I hugged rare creatures:

I enjoyed views of the Palm Jumeirah from a pool-bar at the official party:

## To Sum Up

Even though I naturally prefer hackathon-like experiences and dev-targeted conferences, it was good for me to get a fresh perspective on things and meet people in real.

If you couldn't make it this year but want to get some conference vibe, check out the [Sui Basecamp 2025 playlists on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Sui-Network/playlists).
