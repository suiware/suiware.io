I had an honor and pleasure of organizing a morning run for the wider blockchain community in Belgrade.

For the run, I chose a green and picturesque peninsula not far from the city center. Ada has multiple sports facilities and beaches, making it a perfect location for any outdoor activities.

I personally enjoyed the run and the opportunity to connect with the community.

Many thanks to the organizations who supported us and everyone who joined the run! See you all next time!
