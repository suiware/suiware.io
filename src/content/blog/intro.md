  Let's meet with Suiware, its founder and current projects.
---

Welcome to the Suiware place, frens! 

At Suiware, we develop tools, templates and SDKs for the Sui ecosystem and also demonstrate how to effectively develop for Sui.

Suiware has been founded by [Kos Komelin](https://x.com/kkomelin) who regularly participate in Sui hackathons and contribute to the Sui ecosystem.

Some of our projects:

- [Sui dApp Starter](https://github.com/suiware/sui-dapp-starter) - the easiest way to start a new React/Move project
- [Sui dApp Kit Theme Creator](https://github.com/suiware/sui-dapp-kit-theme-creator) - a simple app that lets you generate a Sui dApp Kit theme by two colors
- [MerSui](https://github.com/suiware/mersui) - a simple "Buy Me a Coffee" React button with payments in SUI

Follow us on [X](https://x.com/suiware_) or [Github](https://github.com/suiware) to ride the wave of everything juicy that's coming next from us!
