The [Sui Agent Typhoon](/posts/suiware-ai-tools-finalist-sui-agent-typhoon-hackathon) hackathon has been a good blast for the AI movement in the Sui ecosystem - and Suiware is no exception. 

I continue improving my hackathon project [@suiware/ai-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suiware/ai-tools). Let me briefly mention the most meaningful updates.

<!--truncate-->

Here is what I've cooked:

1. Added support for multiple coins to the suiSwapTool.
2. Introduced suiStakeTool and suiUnstakeTool for staking Sui natively.
3. Added suiAddressTool which lets you view your current Sui address.
4. The suiWalletBalanceTool now displays all non-zero coins, including natively staked Sui.
5. Added a new example utilizing gemini-2.0-flash-001 model from Google.

The [examples](https://github.com/suiware/ai-tools/blob/HEAD/packages/examples/README.md) have already been updated to reflect these changes - check them out.

In the meantime, I'm also working on an MCP server for the Suiware AI tools, so stay tuned!
