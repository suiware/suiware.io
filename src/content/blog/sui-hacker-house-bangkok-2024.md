  Kos Komelin shares his experience of attending the Sui Hacker House in Bangkok.

In November 2024, I spent about two weeks among Sui builders from different countries at Sui Hacker House in Bangkok.

For context, a hacker house is a hotel/hostel with a co-working space and a room for workshops. Normally a hacker house assumes a hackathon with prizes and ours was not an exception.

Here is what I got out of the hacker house:

- Met 30+ bright Sui minds. We built together, laughed together, ate together, supported each other and made friends.

- Met Sui DevRels in person. I told about my projects, shared my vision, got feedback and some ideas.

- Collected feedback about [Sui dApp Starter](https://sui-dapp-starter.dev) from hackers. I was focusing on finding things which were not smooth in the starter and I got some really valuable improvement ideas in return.

- Learned and accepted my limitations. At some point, I stumbled upon not being able to manage my time effectively because of EF DevCon and 900+ side events happening in parallel. Thanks to some advice, I eventually accepted the fact that I would miss a lot of interesting stuff, which helped to release stress and move on with no regrets.

- And finally, I created [MerSui](https://mersui.xyz), a project which I needed myself and which I wanted to help the community support good content efforts of each other.

I came back home energized, motivated and well-equipped with some nice Sui merch.

Huge shout-out to all Sui people involved in organizing the house!
