My team got to the finals of the [Walrus Breaking the Ice](https://www.breakingtheice.xyz/) hackathon, which meant we earned $500 bounty.
I decided to spent my part on incentives for ETHSofia hackers who would build on Sui with [Sui dApp Starter](https://sui-dapp-starter.dev). 

<!--truncate-->

Now when the hackathon is over, I'm happy to announce the winner of the Sui dApp Starter reward of 100 SUI...

Meet [DefyRent](https://github.com/aeither/DefyRent) - a Decentralized Rent Deposit Platform. 

Congratulations to the team and good luck with future advancement of the project!
